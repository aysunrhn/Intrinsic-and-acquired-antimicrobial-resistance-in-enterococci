# Intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance in enterococci

In this repository, you can find the scripts we used to conduct a study of intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance traits in enterococci. Recognizing the prevalence of enterococci in the guts of all animals, and their clinical significance as the leading causes of many hospital-acquired infections, we performed a comprehensive analysis of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci. 

We have generated the largest collection of Enteroccus genomes, expanding the number of known species. We adopted an unbiased approach to identify new species in the public databases, and we provide a higher resolution view of the four main clades within Enterococcus that had been established in previous work.

To study intrinsic resistance in enterococci, we have developed a standardized approach to define intrinsic resistance and differentiate it from acquired or sporadic resistance traits. Our approach is applicable to a broad range of bacteria, and if you find our code useful please cite this repository.
